# ROULETTE GAME

This is a fully functional roulette game for Joker Games case project.

## How To Play
The game has the exactly same rules with the classic European Roulette Game. When the game starts, you'll see the roulette table with the wheel. You have red roulette chip that you can move around. Simply drag and drop it onto the roulette numbers. Based on your placement and roulette rules, the selected numbers will be highlighted.

You can choose the amount of your bet by clicking left and right arrow icons.

You can "Cheat" or simply test the game integrity using the cheat input field at right-bottom corner. Entering a number there will force the ball to land onto that number when you spin.

When you're ready, simply click on "BET!" button and wait for the ball animation to end.
